# ROS Navigation and Velocity Control Simulation
This project simulates a robot navigating towards a goal and a car traveling at different speeds in various weather conditions and cities.

## Overview
The project contains the following ROS nodes:

Navigate2D - A ROS action that simulates a robot navigating towards a specified goal.
VelocityController - A ROS node that simulates a car driving at random speeds between 30 and 150 km/h. It also provides information about the car type (Ferrari, Chevrolet, or Kia), weather (sunny, cloudy, or rainy), and city (Incheon, Seoul, or Pusan) which are selected randomly.
